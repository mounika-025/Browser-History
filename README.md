Description
The Browser History app is designed to help users manage and search through a list of history items. It provides functionalities such as displaying history items with delete buttons, searching for specific history items, deleting items from the list, and displaying an empty history view when needed.

Features
The app includes the following features:

Initial Display: Upon launching the app, the list of given history items will be displayed. Each history item will be accompanied by a delete button, allowing users to remove specific items from the list.

Search Functionality: Users can enter a non-empty value in the search input field to search for history items. The search is case-insensitive, meaning that the app will display history items that include the search input, regardless of the case of the characters.

Delete History Items: Clicking the delete button associated with a history item will remove the respective item from the list of history items. This feature allows users to manage and delete specific entries as desired.

Empty History View: If a non-empty value is provided in the search input field, but no history item includes the provided value, the app will display an "Empty History View." This view indicates that there are no matching history items based on the search criteria.

Empty History View on Deletion: When all the history items are deleted from the list, the app will display an "Empty History View." This view informs users that there are no remaining history items to display.

Usage

If the search input field has a non-empty value, but there are no history items that include the search input, the app will display an "Empty History View."
